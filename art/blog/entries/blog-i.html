                        <p>
                            This week, I got my laptop back! Everything is back up and running as usual, the only downside is that I lost pretty much all of my programs on my computer but it’s all right since I have all of my files.

                            As far as class this week, I enjoyed the “Feels Good Man” movie we watched. I have always wanted to know a little more about the Pepe memes since I’ve seen them several times in Twitch streamers’ chats so it was cool to see the origin of that (definitely not what I had expected). I also felt really bad that the frog started being used more negatively in the past few years. Since I had seen it being used in a more positive way on Twitch, I had no idea it had such controversies mentioned in the documentary.

                            Aside from all the above, I went to Dairy Queen yesterday for the first time in who knows how long. I decided to try a Blizzard for the first time in my life and it turned out pretty good. However, one thing I realized during my time in the drive-thru line was that one of the workers inside had their mask entirely down/off. Now, I assume we have all seen people not follow mask policies, but this got me thinking about all the stores I have been to for groceries and all the people that choose to either take off their mask once they enter the store or the people that wear their mask incorrectly (i.e. under their nose). By this point in the pandemic, I believe everyone should have figured out the correct way to wear a mask if the reason is that they do not know how to. As for the ones that know exactly how to wear one but choose not to wear it correctly or at all, I find it overall very rude to society if in a public setting that can affect others. Even if an individual does not believe in masks slowing the spread of the virus, simply by the fact that most people are wearing it I believe that people need to do it at least for the sake of their surroundings. I was at a fast-food restaurant about a month ago (picking up my food) and there was a customer that chose to use a scarf to cover her mouth when speaking and let it down whenever she wasn’t talking. Usually, I never say anything in public about this topic, but that day I just felt the urge to simply address that she should consider wearing an actual mask next time. This led to a mini debate in the restaurant, and I ended up letting go of the conversation because I didn’t want to create a larger scene. I feel like I was right in that situation but I don’t know, maybe I’m not allowed to address a concern in the midst of this pandemic when it very well could affect me and people around me who were in that line at that restaurant…
