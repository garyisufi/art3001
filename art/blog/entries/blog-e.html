                        <p>
                            This week, I learned a little bit more about how to structure my website following Dalena's and Hirad's tips during studio time. I am getting more and more familiar with how to use grids to style my website. Following along on this, I spent the majority of this week redesigning my website. I decided to add an interactive element to my title screen where the user has to type in my name in order to make it into the actual site (there’s a secret term you can enter that will be an easter egg later on). I felt this would be a good idea for my website because my goal is to portray all of my software/work projects on this website in the future and having possible recruiters or strangers type in my name will likely force them to even slightly remember my name lloll. I’m still working through the individual designs of each section of my website but luckily, I got the title screen up and working as of now.

                            The theme I am trying to go with is sort of like a terminal. I want to have the background remain dark with some accent colors in the headers, nav, buttons, etc. I originally went in with the idea of having a 1 page site in which you unwrap everything as you scroll down but then I felt it would be cooler for the main page to land onto another page after the user has entered my name. My biggest issue right now is that the landing page is very basic and bland (besides having a nav bar at the top, I am struggling to think of what else to add). I hope to figure this out as I think through and work on the project this upcoming week (P.S. thank you Hirad and Dalena for pushing back the deadline to March 2nd).

                            Outside of internet art related things for the week, I did not do much. I decided to take a step back from steak research and focus more of my time on things that matter more… Mario and Call of Duty. I went through a couple of worlds in the ‘new’ 3D world mario game with my girlfriend and pumped out 2 wins in COD: Warzone for the week. That’s about it for my week!
