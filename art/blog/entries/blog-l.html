                            One thing I liked about this week was the Twine lesson. I had no idea there were tools out there that can help with storytelling like such. Not only did it simplify the process of creating hypertext stories, but it seemed to be a very clean transition into VSCode. Even though I am not interested in creating a hypertext for my final project, I can definitely see this tool being useful for potential future projects. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            As far as the final project, I spent some time this week thinking about that. I decided that it might be a good idea to finish up other parts of my website such as adding a resume section to the ‘experiences’ page and populating the ‘projects’ page with software projects I have worked on. I thought about potentially making the ‘me’ page particularly more interactive but I’m unsure of how I would go about this or what to add. I also thought about adding a small 2D game that allows the user to walk through a small story about me for that page, but that may be a bit too difficult so we will see. Anyway, I will figure something out.

                        <p>
                            Aside from all that, I don’t have anything exciting to talk about this past week. I have been working on a data mining project all weekend long so nothing fun there lol. Sorry I have nothing else to add, so I’ll be cutting this blog a bit short. I hope everyone had a great week/weekend though!
