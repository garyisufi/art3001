                            The start of this week began with a massive grind to get all pages created for my new site for this class. I had already designed a lot of the website features but had to code a majority of everything Sunday and Monday. I actually really enjoyed this project as it kind of forced to go out of my shell and spend more time designing things rather than just coding what I’ve been tasked to do for work or school projects. I, especially, had a lot of fun (and struggles) bringing in the three.js model for the home page. Funny story about that is that I didn’t discover which exact model to put on the home page until 3 am the day the project was due so I had to quickly figure out how to bring everything in. I struggled with changing the paths within the JS files specifically because each file was referencing some other file and three.js originally had default paths.

                            Going on with the project 1 topic, I just want to say that everybody did an insanely good job with their sites. Everybody offered something unique varying from simple and minimalistic to complex and characteristic (that rhymes like Eminem). One site that really caught my eye was Christian’s homepage. I found it very similar to the Finder application we have on apple devices. When I originally viewed the site, I didn’t think to move the folders/pages around but after the presentation it hit me that the feature actually makes the entire site that much closer to mimicking the behavior of the Finder application. And we all spend a lot of time on either File Explorer (windows) or Finder (macOS) so this behavior was very relatable.

                            Aside from this class, I had to work on another project this week for my data mining class. In fact, I am still working on this now as it is due Sunday. This project is very boring and difficult but I have to get through it anyway since I signed up for this class lol.

                            One funny thing that happened to me today is that part of my ceiling fell. Ever heard the saying “the sky is falling” from Chicken Little? Well something similar happened to me, just NO WHERE near the same extent as the movie. I picked up my pillow earlier today to move it to my bed and smacked the ceiling a little bit (my ceilings aren’t very high up in this apartment). As the pillow hit the ceiling, parts of the “Jared” texture fell down to the floor making somewhat of a mess. I originally did not know the ceiling texture is called “Jared” but now after researching it a little bit, I have found out that this popcorn like ceiling texture is used to cover up flaws in the ceiling. This makes me wonder, is my ceiling having problems and those were just its tears coming down?
