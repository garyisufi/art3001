                            This week, we talked more about project 1. The lesson Dalena demonstrated using Illustrator and HTML to structure the design of our website was very helpful. I have used Illustrator before but I did not think to use it that way in order to lay out the site. However, as I began thinking about my sites design more, I realized that I do not really like the design I created for my site as much as I did back when I created it for the assignment. I spent some time this week thinking about my redesign and found some inspiration from sites like http://findmatthew.com/ and https://www.adhamdannaway.com/. I believe it’s a good idea to go with a design that’s professional and can fit a portfolio for all my future work in software engineering, as well as having some creative art elements to the site so that it is fun to navigate.

                            In terms of my week outside of class, I spent some time preparing for Valentine’s Day. I planned to continue attempting to perfect my steak from last week and make steak on Valentine’s Day for my girlfriend. Whole Foods had a really great deal on steak so I capitalized on this opportunity to use a slightly more expensive cut for the special day. I paired the steak up with some mushrooms and broccoli along with mashed potatoes. Everything ended up working out fine, except a portion of the steak…

                        <p>
                            The steak was not very well cooked throughout. Some areas were very well done while some areas were partially rare. Everything ended up tasting great nonetheless but I was still slightly disappointed that I did not master an even cook throughout for the steak. I will continue my endeavors on steak research to make sure I get a perfectly cooked piece of steak.

                            As far as dessert goes for Valentine’s Day, I realized that Graeter’s Ice Cream in containers from Giant Eagle is not very well packaged. It has a “seem” or such that you can pull to officially open the container; however, once you pull that seem, ice cream is already exposed and will start melting instantly. I think this is poor design because I had not even opened the lid yet, I had just pulled the seem. The ice cream did taste good though, so I do give them that, good job Graeters! (I will be sticking with Handel's Homemade Ice Cream in the future)

                        <p>
                            Oh by the way, Happy Valentine's Day!
                        </p>
