                            I would like to start this blog off with an update to my previous blog about the mask situation. I didn’t expect to write about this again but I just so happened to visit the same restaurant again to pick up my food this week and noticed a difference. The restaurant had updated their mask policy with a sheet of paper around where you begin ordering your food. The new policy specifically states that masks must be worn at all times that the customer is in the restaurant unless they are “seated at a table and eating”. For a while now I have contemplated if I was correct in the situation described in last week’s blog but this statement proved it to me that I was in fact in the right. I had submitted a complaint for the restaurant before so maybe that made a difference, but regardless of if it did, I am happy they are doing a better job enforcing a stronger policy.

                            Aside from that, I noticed something interesting this past weekend. As I was driving by a small river, I saw 2 adults throw something into the river. Originally, I thought this was a rock or something of that nature. As I looked a little closer, I realized it was a plastic bottle. I was kind of shocked by this. It’s crazy how uneducated some people can be to just litter so openly like that and think it’s no big deal. Something like that is bound to backfire on us at some point way in the future and it is sad.

                            Lastly, I would like to close off with another sad note. A small update on my “steak research”. This past week I decided to take another stab at cooking steak. However, this went terribly wrong. In fact, I cooked the worst steak I have ever cooked in my life! Parts of the inside were raw (I think) … I would like to slightly blame it on the fact that I was sort of in a rush but anyway that is still my fault. I have figured out a plan for next week and I am excited to try again. Hopefully this upcoming week doesn’t turn out to be like last week’s mess lol.
