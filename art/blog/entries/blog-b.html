                        <p>
                            I enjoyed learning more about CSS this week. It’s especially interesting to me because at work I am currently using CSS and JavaScript to customize a page for the company and the lessons we learned this week tied in very well with that project. My goal in that project is to redesign this platform page for company videos and I spent a lot of my time this week looking at the CSS files so when we started working with CSS in class, it kind of refreshed my mind to think of certain styling obstacles more simply. More specifically, looking at the CSS files for work and trying to make changes was confusing because of all the things going on for the website, but working with CSS on our new website in art class kind of took me back to approach the project with a clearer mindset. 
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            I’m also surprised that I’m seeing what I’m doing at work in an art class. It didn’t occur to me when I signed up for this class that I would be doing this type of programming (which is awesome). 
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            Aside from the CSS, I also found the quick lesson on ordered and unordered lists very helpful. I did not know that "ol" and "ul" meant ordered and unordered list. I feel like I should have figured this out a while ago but I kind of just ignored it since all the lists I have created at work have been unordered lists, so I didn’t really bother to look into the ordered list. It’s awesome I finally know the difference now.

                            As far as outside of class for this week, I don’t really know what I did. I spent some time finding a board game to play because I have been getting a bit tired of playing video games every time I have some free time lloll. I ended up picking up the game “Pandemic”. I had heard great things about this board game but I had been avoiding it for the longest time simply because of its name. Since we are in a pandemic right now, I didn’t really want to play a game focused around that just so I can take my mind off of things. However, I got tired of looking up board games and just decided to give it a shot. It turns out the game is actually as amazing as everyone said it is. It was actually kind of funny because after my first trial run of the game, I decided to take it very seriously the second game and followed a more realistic strategy of containing the spread of each disease before it spread wildly. This strategy ended up working very well. I think that being in the situation we are in right now with the world kind of gave me a different approach on the game (which I think is very cool).
