                            This week, I was part of the discussion where I talked about Data Streams. It was interesting to learn about many ways data is being tracked in the day-to-day things we do while we don’t even realize it because it remains so hidden. This lead to several good discussions about the topic in the class, in which I enjoyed hearing others’ opinions on the topic of data streams.

                            Outside of class, I spilled a LARGE glass of water on my laptop this week. It almost seemed like all of the water went straight into the laptop keyboard and out the other side! This was extremely frustrating as I need my laptop for many projects in CSE. But luckily… I have apple care. The day I decided to purchase apple care for my laptop, I was very doubtful I would never actually need to utilize it but this weekend I proved that I did need it and it kind of saved me over $1000. I should be getting my repaired laptop back mid to end of this week so I shouldn’t fall too behind in coursework (hopefully).

                            To relieve some stress from my laptop tragedy, I went tubing this week. I had never gone tubing before and didn’t know there was such a thing as fake snow but wow it was cool. I decided to pick a tubing place that cares the most about the pandemic (i.e. maintaining strict social distancing and mask policy) just to ensure I was safe for my tubing experience. What was really funny is that I started to become sorta secretly competitive and low-key raced individuals a couple lanes apart from me haha. I managed to secure the championship 3 rounds in a row but lost the throne in the last rep. What I learned from this experience is that weight matters a lot in tubing. My girlfriend and I lost to a team of 3 members because I’m assuming they weighed more than me and my girlfriend. The first 3 wins, we won because many people were tubing individually so we are able to make it down the hill faster with our combined weight. Its cool how physics comes into play with fun activities in life lol.
