                            This week, I enjoyed learning more about how to start up our own site using HTML. I had worked with sites before but it had been a long time since I actually started one up from scratch so this was very useful. One thing I found interesting and enlightening was typing up certain tags like “html” or “nav” and hitting the TAB key to automatically put the tag inside <> carrots. I do not know how I did not learn this trick throughout all 4 years studying Computer Science and Engineering at OSU. It’s so much easier and makes the process of programming go by much smoother. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another thing I found very helpful/useful is the live server extension (“Go Live”) we added to our Visual Studio Code. This extension simplifies the process of updating and seeing your changes an incredible amount. I believe I’ll be using that extension so much in my near future with other classes I am taking this semester and hopefully in my career. In addition to the Go Live feature, I had no idea about GitHub Pages. This makes it so much easier to share changes with other people.
                        </p>

                            Aside from the coding, I also found our discussion this week interesting. Learning more about the internet and hearing the story about the term “Surfing the web” was very cool. It’s neat how that saying rose to become so common. 
                        </p>

                            Meanwhile, outside of class this week I discovered a store that has many collectible items and several of which had something to do with Spider-Man. During my visit, I managed to get a copy of the first cosmic spidey appearance in the Marvel comic books! Not only that, I got it for a very nice price! This is my first Spider-Man comic book and I will keep this one safe for many years to come. However, while I was at the store, I also found this Funko Pop figure that I knew one of my friends would really appreciate and ended up surprising him with it at his front porch (while still maintaining social distancing). After I gave him the surprise, he told me he had something for me as well and it was a spider-man logo keyboard keycap. I found this small gift very thoughtful and cannot wait to put it to use once I actually build my own PC because I have not gotten around to doing that yet.
