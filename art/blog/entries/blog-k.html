                            Over the instructional break this week, I took a trip to Ann Arbor to pick up some Joe’s Pizza and travel right back to Columbus. I know it sounds bizarre to travel 3 hours simply for pizza but here me out in the next paragraph.

                        <p>
                            The first time I discovered Joe’s Pizza was pure out of coincidence as I was visiting Ann Arbor Michigan. I noticed the logo as it is the same pizza Tobey Maguire delivered in the Spiderman movies (specifically the second movie which is the best one!). I thought the pizza place is only in New York City but apparently, they have exactly only location outside of New York and that location happens to be Ann Arbor Michigan. Now, moving on to the food review, wow the pizza is great. It brings the New York pizza touch over to us in a way I have yet to taste elsewhere here in Ohio/Michigan. I can only imagine how great the pizza would taste to eat dined-in at the restaurant, fresh and warm. You can really tell how important the pizza is to Tobey Maguire for him to deliver such great pizza. [Fun Fact: my hyperlink story for this class involves Joe’s Pizza]

                            Aside from the pizza, this past weekend I watched Avatar for the first time. Not the last airbender, but the blue people movie. I found the movie to be really good as it kind of opened me up to a different perspective of our world. The movie does a great job showing the perspective of a group of people (some may consider aliens) having their land being invaded and them trying to fight back for what they care about. This kind of got me thinking about animals and how, we as people, get rid of a lot of their land. For example, chopping down trees where birds live in nests right above. Another interesting point about the movie was the focus of money and how that seemed to be the root of the evil witnessed in the movie. It’s crazy how far people will go simply for the purpose of money.

                            I would like to end this blog off with a description of my experience drinking celery juice (green juice). I am going to use the term “wow”, sort of like I did with Joe’s Pizza, but in a negative way! I have never experienced such strong urges of throwing up from juice. It was even worse than the spirulina juice I tried in the past. I thought it wouldn’t be too bad, but it was unbearable. One thing I know for sure is that I am never making juice with the primary ingredient being celery. Anyone who does drink this is strong and legendary, good for you!
