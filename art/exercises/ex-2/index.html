                            The day I lost my very first tooth,
                            <br>Was halfway through grade four,

                            <br>Where my tooth had been before,
                            <br>I remember I went home crying,
                            <br>And showed it to my mum,
                            <br>She told me that a brand new tooth,
                            <br>Would grow up in my gum,
                            <br>In a while the gap would stop feeling strange,
                            <br>I wouldn't notice the <span style="background-color: yellow;">tooth</span> was gone,
                            <br>The only reason I missed it now,
                            <br>Was because it was there for so long,
                            <br>Then slowly but surely over the weeks,
                            <br>In the gap a new tooth grew,
                            <br>And now it makes me wonder,
                            <br>If people are like teeth too.
