            I found this week very interesting because we got introduced to project 1. I think that the amount of freedom we are given to explore different layouts and create something fresh from scratch is amazing in this class. I have been enjoying thinking about different design ideas for my website and am continuously thinking about different ways to make it interactive since I have never done that before with a website. The short mention about CSS animations really surprised me (in a good way) since I want to make certain animated features for my site. I also really appreciated the discussion about different programs to use for designing our mock-up site. I didn’t know we had so many design resources at our fingertips and I realize how much this could help me in the future as well.

            One idea I have thought about for my site has been to have a Funko Pop gallery since I always find myself struggling to remember which Spider-Man pop figures I have and don’t have whenever I’m browsing in stores. I know that I could easily just use some app that already exists to keep track of these, but I feel it would be nicer to have my own section for it on my site so that I can customize it however I choose to.

            Aside from internet art, recently I have been trying to eat healthier and have started cooking more frequently. This past week I taught myself a new steak recipe and have been experimenting with a few vegetables to pair the steak up with on the side (mostly just broccoli though). However, there is some bad news. This week’s steak was very salty. Although I am happy I made something edible, I also realize that I put way too much salt when seasoning the meat so next time I plan to use significantly less salt.

            In addition to the steak, I also made some crepes this past Friday. It had been a long time since I made crepes, but it was very refreshing to experiment with them again. I forgot a lot of the steps and ingredients so it was a little rough at first but then after a couple failed attempts, the remainder of the crepes turned out great. I chose to go with banana Nutella crepes as that’s always been my favorite flavor. Since IHOP no longer makes banana Nutella crepes, might as well learn how to make them myself lol.
