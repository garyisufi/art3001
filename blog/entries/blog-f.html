            This week’s class was studio time, so I spent some more time working on my project. Instead of actually coding, I decided to draw out a design for how I want each individual page to look like. I plan to leave all non-art related pages empty with “coming soon..” text on the page for now since they aren’t in the scope of this project. However, I have all pages ready to be customized for the future when I do decide to update them. I also spent a little bit of time learning more about CSS animations, more specifically the transform ones. My goal is to make an infinitely scrolling horizontal home button at the top of my site.

            Outside of class, I went for a drive by Dayton to explore some of the companies I had recognized at last semesters career fair (specifically the computer science ones). This was a very random trip but since we had 2 days of instructional break, I thought I would do a bit of exploring. While I was down there, I also drove by Dayton University and Wright State University. I have found that driving around is actually very fun given you are seeing something new, especially during this pandemic.

            Towards the end of my week, I traveled back home for my dad’s birthday. I had a lot of fun spending some time back at home but was really shocked at the input delay in the old TVs I used to play video games on before college. I currently use a monitor now in college to play my games and was blown away at how crazy the difference is. My monitor handles input delay sooo much faster and it’s much cheaper than the TVs I tried playing on. Even with the same resolution and frame rate, the input delay is just off on the TVs. I bet this isn’t much of a case for newer TVs but still this was very interesting to me. I also find this a little scary because it’s one of those things that once you upgrade, you can never go back.
